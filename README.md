# IMDb Sentiment Analysis
Data Mining term project.

This project uses the [IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which is included in the repository under the `aclImdb` folder.
<hr>
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative. The analysis is performed using a <b>manually implemented</b> Logistic Regression model, and <b>no pre-built machine learning libraries</b> are used for training.
<br><br>

Key features include:
- Manual data preprocessing (e.g., stopword removal, stemming, punctuation cleaning).
- Manual implementation of Bag of Words (BoW) for feature extraction.
- Logistic Regression classifier implemented from scratch.
- Visualizations for insights, model performance, and evaluation metrics.
